# Forms and JS Events



### Forms

Forms in HTML are the equivalent to forms in the real world, they allow us to input values and content in which we can use in order to make even more dynamic web applications, most obvious example is the Google search, its the most popular example of filling forms in HTML, you simply input whatever you want and click search then the search engine will compare what you input to the accessable internet data base.


Also, another example is inputing your username / password / email whenever you are creating a new account on a website, example code of an element that you can input text into.


```
<form action="http://www.example.com/login.php">
<p>Username:
<input type="text" name="username" size="15"
maxlength="30" />
</p>
</form>
```

which would make a box that we can input text inside.



### JS Events



Events in Javascript the browser's way of indicating when something has happened, for example when a page has finished loading, or when the user clicks on the page, those events helps us as developers to craft interactive experiences for the users.


How do events work ? events work by waiting until a specific action is made then call a function that we assigned to fire whenever this event was triggered, for example, when a user clicks a specific element, a function will be called, then that function would extend the content of that element thus creating a dynamic webpage that the user can use.


One of my most favorite web applications that heavily make use of events, is [Tier List Maker](https://tiermaker.com/), it allows users to dynamically create thier own lists of their favorite things and move the list elements back'n forth between list rows.
