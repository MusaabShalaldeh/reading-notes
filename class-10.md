# Debugging



Debugging is one of the most important skills to learn as a developer in genenral, since debugging is the process of finding whats wrong in your code / errors. Usually us, as web developers we use the browser console help us find errors, whenever it catches an error in our code it will print out an message containing what the error might be and at which line it found it.

Furthermore, as a programmer, you must learn how the order of execution works(running code from top to bottom), which is going to help you prevent execution order errors such as calling an expression function before writing it.

Speaking of errors, there are many common errors such as syntax errors specially in strict syntax languages, missing characters or numbers and data type issues, for example, array as an argument to a string or number parameter.

With this many errors mentioned, lets not forget about few tips to help you discover whats wrong, sometimes the errors can be browser specific, so in that case try using another browser or whenever you are not sure if your code is running or not, use console.log() method to confirm if its running or not, as well as searching what is the error the console gave you, you may not understand it, but searching it could help a ton as there is a chance 1000 in 1 that someone else faced you problem and talked about it online.
