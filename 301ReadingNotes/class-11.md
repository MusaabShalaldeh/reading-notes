|_Databases are table based databases_|_Databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores_|
|_Databases have predefined schema_|_Databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data_|
|_Databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful_|_database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database._|
