### Who is Roy Fielding?

A- Roy Thomas Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

A- Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

A- HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
