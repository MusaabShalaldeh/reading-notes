# Version Control Summary.

Version Control is a system that allows you to upload your own projects, share them and record any change that occurs to your projects along side allowing you to revisit any previous
versions of your projects.

It all started by programmers making their owr VCS stored on their harddrives, but need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). 
This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases).
, but this system has the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions.
