# Web Pages Structure with HTML Summary.

Structing Web Pages is one of main things to do whenever you as a Web Developer wanting to create a website,
it adds not only uniqueness and cool asthetic, but it also helps the user to navigate through your website at ease without having hard time, it is mainly done by **Wire Framing** which I am gonna explain below.



### Wire Framing

*Wire Framing* is the practice which is used by **UX Desginers** that allows them to plan _what goes where_ on the website, as an example I am going to show an Image that shows one of the early stages of thinking about the design of the site
![Example_1](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dbb80f2f6a5dafa25f702ad00bc429057fb59cec/52716/en/blog/uploads/versions/samuel-student-wireframe---x----972-715x---.png)



Also, there are couple of ways that you can use to _wireframe_ your site:

1. Hand Drawing.
2. Digitally Using Special Tools.

### HTML

HTML language helps you to further *customize, edit and manipulate* your designed web page, for example; a Header at the top to gain the attention of the user:

***<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>***

aswell as you can manipulate its size furthermore by changing its size or color.



And to finish off, one must always aim to keep it clear and easy which also gains the confidence of the user and to always remember, simplicity is key.
