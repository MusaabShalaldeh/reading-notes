# Growth Mindset.

It is the concept of one's abilities and way of thinking about approaching learning new stuff through _consistancty_ and love of learning, also taking challanges as a way of improving instead of an hard obstacle that makes you easily give up.

###### Few Reminders to keep a Healthy Growth Mindset

1. Keeping in mind that there is **no _gain_ without _pain_**, alot of effort has to be put in order to achieve your goals.
2. **Taking criticism with an _open mind_** no matter how strong it is, and using that criticism as a way to *improve yourself*.
3. ***Success of others doesn't mean that you are a failure***, but you must take it as a goal to achieve for yourself aswell.
