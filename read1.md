# Markdown Language

**Markdown** is a way to style text on the web, mainly on a site which is called _Github_, 
it is used to control the display of the text which is __very helpful__ to describe your own projects and __communicate__ with your teammates.

There are many ways of making your text look organized and tidy, such as using Headers and Lists or Nested Lists, documentation can be found [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

To finish off, In my opinion, I think its a must to use Markdown to organized text specially if you are working with teammates to help them aswell navigate through the text.
