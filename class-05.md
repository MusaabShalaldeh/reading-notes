# Images, Color and Text in HTML and CSS


It is a necessity to make user of Images, Color-text, background colors etc... when making a webpage that is desireable to look at, as it helps to illustrate your idea or vision about the website, so lets discuss what and how can we use them in our web pages.

### Images

Images as of definition are a representation of the external form of a person or thing in art, so when you are making your webpage, you want to present it in the best possible way, for example adding a site logo, or an image following an article, also there are are many types images such as jpeg, png and gifs.


To add images on your website, first, you must either have a link address of the image you want or have that image uploaded to your website, preferably under an folder specifically made for images.


**Example code of adding 2 images, 1 from the web and within our server files**
```
<img src="myImages/garden.jpg" alt="a garden image">


<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/158028/bellingrath-gardens-alabama-landscape-scenic-158028.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500" alt="a garden with street image">
```

further more, you can repostion, rescale width and height of images to fit your need.


### Colors and Text in CSS and HTMl

what would a site full of beautfiul images and boring text and only black colors feel like ? weird, right? how about bringing it to life ?

To bring life to a webpage, we must much make use of tools that CSS offers to customize our webpages, like changing text size, changing text style, changing background colors etc....

Also it is essentioal to understand the concepts of color, as a front-end developer or potentially a graphic designer aswell, you always want to have colors match as it helps with readability of your webpage, moreover having better ratings about your website.

**Code example in css of changing background color, and making text look prettier in a paragraph**:

```
body{
    background-color: blueviolet;
}


main article p{
    text-align: center;
    color: rgb(2, 30, 56);
    margin: 100px;
    font-size: 30px;
}

```
