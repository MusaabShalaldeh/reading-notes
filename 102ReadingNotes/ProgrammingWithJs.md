# Programming with Javascript

### Summorization of what I've learnt so far.


### Expressions & Operators:

what are they and what are they used for ?

Expressions perform specific actions, based on an operator, with one or two operands. An operand can be a constant, a variable or a function result. 

### Loops:

Loops are repeated sequences of instructions until a specific condition is met, which is very useful in programming to help do repeated actions easily, and there are 2 types of it:

1. While Loops

2. For Loops

### Functions:

what are functions ?

A set of predefined commands(or block of code) to be executed at any time with the ability to re-use them, you can also pass arguments to those functions to furthermore have more utility and flexibility.
