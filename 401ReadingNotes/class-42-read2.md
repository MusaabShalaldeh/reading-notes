# "The code I’m still ashamed of" Article.

In my opinion, I agree with the writer of that article as we developers become more responsible for our products/website, specifically if they are promoting something that may cause harm to others and we have to becareful and think about ethics first, rather than thinking about the money which would come of it, as well as doing our best to provide the better for our communities.


# "Self Driving Car Ethics" Article.

From my understanding of that article, Auto cars has been both defended and attacked. When humans get into the driver’s seat of a car, positive law states that they take full responsibility for their actions. When it comes to self-driving cars, there is a clear gray area: is the driver responsible for any harm to innocent bystanders who get hurt from self-driving cars? Or is the self-driving car responsible for harm to innocent bystanders? Human drivers and self-driving cars who get into accidents must make split-second moral choices on whether to protect themselves or others. Because of the grey area, there have been many debates on whether self-driving cars are ethical.
