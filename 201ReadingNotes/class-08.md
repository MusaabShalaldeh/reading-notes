# CSS Layout


### Understanding The Layout in CSS


To understand how layouts work, we must keep in mind few key concepts in postioning of elements:

1. Block-level elements start on a new line.

2. Inline elements flow in between surrounding text.

3. Containing Elements, which means if an element is inside another element, the latter element is going to be a child of the element thats it is inside thus its going to move/ get repostioned with it





The next step is to know how Controlling the Position of Elements works, we got 5 types of postions which are:

1. Normal flow: Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one which is the default positioning in HTMl.

2. Relative Positioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.

3. Absolute positioning: This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements.

4. Fixed Positioning: which is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed
to the containing element,also it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements.

5. Floating Elements: which allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. it also that element becomes a block level element aswell.

Now as a reader, you would ask why do we need to learn such thing ? the answer for that is latetly with more advanced technology, there are plenty of different screen sizes and its important for us as developers to have a consistant look between most of those screens/ devices.

There are 2 types of layouts, fixed width or liquid with each one having its own advantages and disadvantages, Furthermore, to make our lives easier we use CSS Frameworks which has many advantages such as saving us from repeatedly writing code for the same tasks, but it also has some disadvantages such as They often require that you use class names in your HTML code.
