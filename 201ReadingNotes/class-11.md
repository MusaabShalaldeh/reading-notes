# Images & Practical Information




### Images in HTMl:

One of the key elements to having a desired webpage or website to read is simply having images in it as images help to break the text and to help illustrate and deliver the idea of the subject.

Along side the previously mentioned use, they are many other uses of images such as having buttons for images, background images and alot more.


Images in HTML are best used with CSS as it gives you alot more image-customization such as repostioning, aligning and even making the images tile/not tile aswell as the ability to resize the image(width & height).


Example code of an image resized and aligned to the center:

```
img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 50%;
  width: 256px;
  height: 256px;
}

```


And an example of changing the background to an image:

```
body {
background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");
}
```
