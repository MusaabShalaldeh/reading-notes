# What Google Learned About Teams



To have the perfect team it doesn't mean to have every single member of that team be an talented person or I should say that they are extremely good at their job necessarily makes the best team, but the shared interests of the team memebers, their own personalities, the ability to find their each team member's weaknesses and work to improve on them.


Furthermore, there are five key characteristics in which the "perfect team" can be made and they are:

1. Psychological safety means Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.

2. Dependability: Everyone completes quality work on time.

3. Structure and clarity: Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.

4. Meaning: Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).

5. Impact: Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.



In conclusion:

The Google researchers found that individuals on teams with higher psychological safety are less likely to leave Google since they're more likely to have many unique ideas from their teammates, they bring in more revenue, and they're rated as effective twice as often by executives.
