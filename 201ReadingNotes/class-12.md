# Chart.js & Canvas


Displaying data in visual form is always far superior than simply displaying data in numbers, thats why in HTML5 we have charts to display data visually using a Javascript plugin called Chart.js that uses Canvas elements to draw the graph onto the page that makes use of all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, also we can install by having it in the work directory.


Canvas elements may seem like image elements, but they are different in someway as they only have width and height attributes with fallback content to display alternatives if an older browser is used to navigate through the webpage.

Also, as all other HTML elements we can style charts/canvas with many different things such as color and styles.



There are pleny of uses for charts such as *visually representing data*, *Drawing shapes* and *Drawing text*:

1. Visually Representing Data:

Which is basically having all boring numbers being respresented in an easy to look at fill bar which allows you to compare data easily without having to look at each number and compare them.

2. Drawing Shapes:

we can manipulate canvas elements to create many weird and beautiful shapes to look at, such as smily faces, arrows, colorful grid pattrens and alot more.

3. Drawing Text:

Not only we can draw shapes, but we can also draw text and infact make our own custom funky fonts.
