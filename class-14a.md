# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations


Animations nowadays are the most essential thing to have in our applications, whether its in mobile applications, games, websites, webapplications and more, although in web pages/sites its mainly 2D animation, such as bouncy balls, Fade-in n Fade-outs, dynamically having colors change, moving element from 1 place to another in real-time and alot more.


### How do animations work ?

Animations mainly work by having the transform property/color property and basically any valid property that can be changed in real time to have its values changed each and every single frame, for example having __background-color: (150,150,150)__ subtract color values from itself each frame until it reaches for example __background-color: (120,75,12)__ which would display that background color of that element change each frame for the user thus creating animations, usually when we want to make animations with css we use freely available liberaries and sources since its alot of work to create an animation system from scratch and save alot of time for us developers.


Aswell as creating transtions, for example having an element that is squared slowly overtime change to circle-shaped element whenever the user hovers over that element's block, furthermore, using animations and all of its sub categories allow us to create pretty and eye catching websites.
